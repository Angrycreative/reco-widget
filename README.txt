Reco is a swedish consumer site where consumers recommend companies to other consumers by giving 'recos'.

This plugin uses a shortcode "[reco-widget]" so that you can show a widget with recos for your company, 
but you must contact reco.se to be able to use this plugin as it requires a "company id" and a "API-Key".
