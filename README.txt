A small plugin to show a realtime widget from the Swedish site reco.se.
At the moment you must contact reco.se to be able to use this plugin.

== Description ==

Reco is a swedish consumer site where consumers recommend companies to other consumers by giving 'recos'. Notice that the plugin is in Swedish only right now as reco.se only are in Swedish anyway.

This plugin uses a shortcode "[reco-widget]" so that you can show a widget with recos for your company, 
but you must contact reco.se to be able to use this plugin as it requires a "company id" and a "API-Key".

All development will be done over at our [github page](https://github.com/Angrycreative/reco-widget)

You can also get more information [here](http://www.angrycreative.se/oppen-kallkod/reco-for-wordpress/) (in Swedish)

e.g.

1. Upload `plugin-name.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
